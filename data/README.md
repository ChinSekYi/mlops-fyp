# Data Directory

This folder contains all data files for the project. Only `.dvc` metafiles are tracked by git; actual data is stored in S3 and managed by DVC.

## What youâ€™ll see after setup

- `/raw`: Original data files for each environment (dev, staging, prod)
- `/processed`: Cleaned/engineered data for model training/testing
- `.dvc` files: Tracked by git/DVC; CSVs are pulled from S3

## How to get the data
Run:
```sh
dvc pull -r <DVC_REMOTE>
# <DVC_REMOTE> is dev, staging, or prod
```
